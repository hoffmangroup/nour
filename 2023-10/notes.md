Made a GitHub repo today that will serve as my lab notebook for now, may move it to valinor later.  
Waiting for valinor access.  
Did more onboarding stuff (calendar/email/GitHub/shared group folder setup and access).
Reading HPV integration paper in more detail. 
Ethics class.

Questions:  
- "We identified HPV integration in each sample using the sequence of the dominant HPV type in that sample." <- does this mean that you have to know the sequence ahead of time, before running Polyidus?
- Should I replicate entire paper, or focus on Polyidus parts?
