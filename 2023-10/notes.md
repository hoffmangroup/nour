# Wednesday October 18th, 2023  
Made a GitHub repo today that will serve as my lab notebook for now, may move it to valinor later.  
Waiting for valinor access.  
Did more onboarding stuff (calendar/email/GitHub/shared group folder setup and access).
Reading HPV integration paper in more detail. 
Ethics class.

Questions:  
- "We identified HPV integration in each sample using the sequence of the dominant HPV type in that sample." <- does this mean that you have to know the sequence ahead of time, before running Polyidus?
- -> All samples were the same HPV?? Unsure, double check this in paper.

# Thursday October 19th, 2023  
Continued going through the paper, and tracking down the datasets.    
Looked through some of Mehran's data directories.  


## Questions:  
- Why did you use RNA-seq for identifying integration sites? Like why not genomic data?
- -> There is no genomic data available apparently.
- Can I work from home tomorrow? (WFH policy in general?)
- -> Yes for tomorrow. WFH in general to be asked at a later time.
- Any good example of software I can look at?
- -> Did not ask. 
- Lab meeting conflict next week
- -> Email Natalia
- Presenting next Wednesday? How long should the presentation be?
- -> Max 25 mins
- Valinor?
- -> Forwarded email again
- Should I replicate entire paper, or focus on Polyidus parts?
- -> Just Polyidus
- H4H instead?
- -> Did not ask

## Notes from meeting:  
DNAseq vs RNAseq differences -> see if you can find genomic data for cell lines, and redo analysis using that instead, see what you find. 
Email Natalia -> CC Michael, lab meeting can't be before Wednesday -> MH can send slides of this project from before (max 25 mins)
Email MH directly about finding meeting time next week
